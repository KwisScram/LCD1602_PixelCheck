# **1602-LCD-PixelCheck**
**Arduino IDE file for a 1602 LCD pixel and backlight check**

<br>
This is a simple Arduino (and C++) repo for testing your LCD display type LCD1602 or LCD1602A.<br>
If you have an Liquid-crystal display type LCD1602 or LCD1602A you can connect as the schematic and upload the sketch.<br>
As a result you will get the "Odd" and "Even" pixels one at the time.

<br/>

## Notes
- Connect the **1602 LCD** according to the schematic
- *See schematic pinsettings*
- After upload to the arduino every second you'll see the even or the odd pixels lite up...

<br/>
<br/>

## Output will look like this

<br/>

Odd | Even
